1.

an int type occupies 4 bytes while a double type occupies 8 bytes,
the ReportData structure contains 3 int and 6 double, so it requires 60 bytes of memory minimum.

to improve passing it to function, we can use pass by address.

for example:

instead of

void displayReportData(const struct ReportData data, const int cheapest);

we can do

void displayReportData(const struct ReportData* data, const int cheapest);
and inside the function we can use the arror notation like data->sku to find the address of the specific element of the structure.

2.
we can do

struct ReportData
{
    struct CatFoodInfo info
    double weight_kg;
    int weight_g;
    double total_serving, cost_per_serving, cost_per_calories;
};

and the printf statement in displayReportData would be:

printf("%07d %10.2lf %10.1lf %10.4lf %9d %8d %8.1lf %7.2lf %7.5lf",
        data.info.sku_number, data.info.price, data.info.weight, data.weight_kg, data.weight_g, data.info.calories, data.total_serving, data.cost_per_serving, data.cost_per_calories);
