1. I successfully put up the code for the non-repetitive sections of logic. Even if it was a bit time-consuming and confusing I did that with a simple way of doing it. I thought about it as a few lines and made it line1,line2,line3 and line4 so that its easy to focus on one thing at a time. The line 1 was a bit harder for me compared to others, I used arrays, flags, and for-loop and put all into a do-while loop.

2. Structures were so useful and made the program simpler than the one without structures. I used the structures PlayerInfo and Gameinfo which made me use fewer variables and made it more readable. If there was no structures I would have made a lot of variables for each player and game.

3.In the part where there was the printing of the position of the player i used 4 nested loops,

do
{
  if(flag==0){}
  else
     {
      for(y = 0; (y < game.path_length) || (flag2 == 0); y++)
	{
	  
                if (recentposition == player.character_symbol)
                {
                }
                else
                {
                }
            }
	 }
     }
}while((remaining_lives<=0)||(remaining_moves<=0));
