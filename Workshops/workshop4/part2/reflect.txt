1. 
can use if or switch

if:

if (month == 11)
{
    printf("NOV");
}
else if (month == 12)
{
    printf("DEC")
}

Switch:

switch (month)
{
    case 11:
        printf("NOV");
        break;
    case 12:
        printf("DEC");
        break;
}

2.
the 3 types of iteration constructs are while, do while, and for.

I used the do while to validate the entered value, cause the do while loop
will always run once before it check the while condiiton, and for validate
the user input, we do need ask the user to enter once no matter what.

3.
For syntactic error, I go through the program once first to see if there's missing
; or ", and check for spellings, and then try run the program once, if there's more 
syntactic error it will show where is wrong and I can fix it.

For semantic error, first run the program to see if I can get the desired answer,
if not, then i need to go back to the code and find the constructs that suppose give
the desired answer, and run through them by brain to see where it went wrong and fix it.
