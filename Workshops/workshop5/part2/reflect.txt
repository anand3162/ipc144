1. By using variables and macros instead of magic numbers the advantages we get are the following:-
	i)   It will be more reusable and general when we use variables because if we use a constant we want to change the 
	     value of the magic numbers for each user.
	ii)  Increased readability when someone tries to understand the code or when you display the code to someone it would
	     be easy for them to understand.
	iii) If we use meaningful names for the variables it will also help us in debugging and finding the error
	     because of the increased readability.

2. The main reason why it is placed outside the iterations is because of better readability, we can see all the calculations
   together so that if there is some kind of error in the calculations we can just check everything in one single place.Also 
   by making it so we are giving each part of the code a certain task.
   
   The second reason is that it will slow the validation process and it is better to go on the regular flow of the code.
   If the calculations are inside the iterations it will unnecessarily drag the validation process. The flow of the code is 
   also changed if done like this, which will affect the debugging too.
