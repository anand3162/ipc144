1. Yes, i do have a limited experience in programming . I studied the first lessons of c and cpp from my classes in grade 12, while i studied the introduction to java from a small two month course.
2.The compiling process of c text file into an executable program includes turning the text file to a .c source code file and then converts the source code to a binary language so that the computer can process the input.
3.I hope that i would achieve better knowledge on different programming languages and learn new things about the computer in general. My goal is to become a software developer and i think I'm on the right track.I expect myself to be more responsible and productive during the program.
