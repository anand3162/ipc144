1.
  (((SERVINGSA>=1&&SERVINGSA<=4)&&(weightgm1>=0&&weightgm1<=250))||((SERVINGSA>4&&SERVINGSA<10)&&(weightgm1>250&&weightgm1<=500))||((SERVINGSA>=10)&&(weightgm1>=1000)))

  At first i thought this would be easy but while i was coding i realized that it is complex.
  Here SERVINGSA is the preference of the first customer and weightgm1 is the weight of the first coffee bag in grams.

  A.>Here i used 4 relational operators:-
				     <(less than)
				     >(greater than)
				     <=(less than or equal to)
				     >=(greater than or equal to)
  B.>Here i used 2 logical operators:-
				    ||(or operator)
				    &&(and operator)

2.
  This is the method without using de Morgan's law
PRODUCT3_ID != PRODUCT1_ID && PRODUCT3_ID != PRODUCT2_ID
and this is the method with de Morgan's law
!(PRODUCT3_ID==PRODUCT1_ID || PRODUCT3_ID==PRODUCT2_ID)
I used the first method without using de Morgan's law.

3. The first way is this. Here variables of each coffee are declared together.

    const double GRAMS_IN_LBS = 453.5924;
    char sold_type1,sold_cream1;int weightgm1;//available coffee1
    char sold_type2,sold_cream2;int weightgm2;//available coffee2
    char sold_type3,sold_cream3;int weightgm3;//available coffee3
    char TYPEA,CREAMA;int SERVINGSA;//coffee entryA
    char TYPEB,CREAMB;int SERVINGSB;//coffee entryB

This is the second way. Here the variables for coffee1,2 and 3 are declared together like coffee type of the three coffee are declared together.

    const double GRAMS_IN_LBS = 453.5924;
    char sold_type1,sold_type2,sold_type3;//available coffee types
    int weightgm1,weightgm2,weightgm3;//available coffee weights
    char sold_cream1,sold_cream2,sold_cream3//available coffee cream option
    char TYPEA,CREAMA;int SERVINGSA;//coffee entryA
    char TYPEB,CREAMB;int SERVINGSB;//coffee entryB
